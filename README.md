## Flask Application Design for [Problem Name]

### HTML Files

- `index.html`: Main HTML file for the application. It will contain the necessary HTML elements to display the user interface.
- `[subfolder]/[detail page].html`: If the application involves multiple pages or sections, additional HTML files will be created. Specify the subfolder and file name based on the application's structure.

### Routes

- `/`: Home route, typically linked to the `index.html` file.
- `/submit`: Form submission route, used to handle data submitted from a form on `index.html`.
- `/logout`: Logout route, used to log a user out of the application.
- `/[dynamic route]`: Dynamic routes, such as `/<id>` or `/<username>`, are used to handle dynamic content based on user input or specific parameters.
- `/api/[route name]`: API routes, used to handle requests from other applications or systems.

### Implementation

- The `index.html` file will contain the basic HTML structure and any necessary forms or user interface elements.
- The `/submit` route will validate the submitted data, process it, and perform any necessary database operations or other logic.
- The `/logout` route will handle logging the user out of the application, clearing the session, and redirecting to the login page.
- Dynamic routes will allow the application to handle specific content based on user input, such as displaying a specific user's profile or a blog post.
- API routes will provide access to the application's data or functionality for other applications to use.
